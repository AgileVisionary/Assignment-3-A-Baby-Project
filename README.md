# Assignment-3-A-Baby-Project
Assignment 3: A Baby Project (BABI 4005)


The dataset is called "Gneshin Impact Character Data" by Sophia Healy via Kaggle.

The Genshin Impact Character Data dataset on Kaggle provides detailed information about all the current playable characters in the popular game Genshin Impact. It includes various attributes such as character names, elements, weapon types, and statistics like attack power (ATK), health points (HP), and defense (DEF)2. This dataset is useful for analyzing character distributions, performance metrics, and exploring patterns within the game's character roster.


Furthermore, this "Assignment 6 branch" is the final branch closing this project. 
Here are the following decisions that had been made: 

Methodology
Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process involved several crucial steps:

Handling Missing Values: Identifying and addressing missing data points to ensure accuracy.

Standardizing Categories: Ensuring consistency in data naming conventions and formatting.

Removing Outliers: Identifying and removing outliers to ensure the reliability of the analysis.

Ensuring consistency in categorical data was particularly challenging, as variations in naming conventions had to be mapped to single values. Additionally, creating new columns, such as the BMI column, required careful unit conversion and formula application.

Data Analysis
Using Jupyter Notebook, I employed various Python libraries, such as Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization. The analysis focused on exploring patterns within the game's character roster and evaluating performance metrics. Key techniques included:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends and patterns in the data.

Correlation Analysis: Examining relationships between different character attributes.

Visualization
Several types of visualizations were created to represent the findings, including bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots, to provide a comprehensive view of the data.

Results
Findings
The analysis revealed several intriguing insights:

Character Distribution: The distribution of character elements and weapon types across the dataset.

Performance Metrics: Correlations between character attributes (e.g., ATK, HP) and overall performance in the game.

Patterns and Trends: Identifying common traits among top-performing characters.

Visuals
Pie Chart: The distribution of characters by weapon type showed the dominance of swords and the relative balance among other weapon types. Figure 1: Distribution of characters by weapon type

Bar Plot: The distribution of characters by vision type highlighted the popularity of certain elements like Cryo, Hydro, and Electro, while Geo and Dendro had fewer characters, reflecting their availability and usage in the game. Figure 2: Distribution of characters by vision type

Boxplot: The distribution of ATK values by vision type at Level 90 revealed variability in attack stats across different elements, with some visions like Pyro having a wider range of ATK values. Figure 3: ATK values by vision type at Level 90

Scatter Plot: The relationship between HP and ATK at Level 90 for different characters and vision types provided insights into the strength and characteristics of characters based on their elemental vision. Figure 4: Relationship between HP and ATK at Level 90 by vision type

Character Model Distribution: The bar chart showing the distribution of characters by model type indicated a preference for Medium Female and Medium Male models in character design. Figure 5: Distribution of characters by model type

Discussion
Challenges
Some of the main challenges included:

Jupyter Coding: Debugging and troubleshooting code that did not execute as expected.

Data Consistency: Dealing with missing or inconsistent data required careful cleaning and preprocessing.

Limited Information: The dataset's descriptive nature limited certain analyses and might be less appealing to others.

Limitations
The dataset had certain limitations, such as incomplete data points and inconsistencies in data naming and formatting. These issues needed to be addressed to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the analysis.

Conclusion
Summary
This project provided valuable insights into the Genshin Impact Character Data and demonstrated my ability to apply data analysis techniques to a real-world dataset. The findings enhance the understanding of character attributes and their impact on gameplay.

Future Work
Future research could explore additional character attributes, analyze the impact of new game updates, or predict future character performance based on historical data.

Reflection
Are you proud of your project? Why or why not?
I am proud of this project based on the new knowledge I have acquired and the time and details it took to apply what I have learned. I am really proud because I have put effort into it, and learning these new concepts using GitHub and Jupyter Notebook was really fun. The project allowed me to delve into data analysis and visualization, enhancing my skills and understanding of these tools.

What did you learn about the topic you chose?
The dataset I chose to work with is "Genshin Impact Character Data" by Sophia Healy via Kaggle. It includes detailed information about all the current playable characters in the game. I learned about the intricacies of character attributes and how they impact gameplay, as well as the importance of data consistency and accuracy in analysis.

What did you learn about working with data in Git?
Working with data in Git taught me the importance of version control and collaboration. Git allows for tracking changes, managing different versions of the project, and collaborating with others efficiently. It also helps in maintaining a history of the project, making it easier to revert to previous versions if needed.
